# Indian Agriculture Data Analytics Project

This project is a data analytics and visualization initiative using the Indian Agriculture dataset. It involves the creation of an extensive dashboard and a predictive model for estimating the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of crops for a given year.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Contains 130,000 records with the following columns:
  - `RowID`: Unique identifier for each record
  - `State_Name`: Name of the state
  - `District_Name`: Name of the district
  - `Crop_Year`: Year of cultivation
  - `Season`: Season of cultivation (e.g., Rabi, Kharif)
  - `Crop`: Type of crop grown
  - `Area`: Area of cultivation (in hectares)
  - `Production`: Crop production (in metric tons)

- **Key Features**:
  - A comprehensive Power BI dashboard showcasing insights into agricultural trends, production patterns, and seasonal impacts.
  - Predictive model for estimating the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of crops based on historical data.

## Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard provides:
- Visual trends in crop production across states and districts over years.
- Seasonal analysis of crop cultivation patterns.
- State-wise comparisons of agricultural output.
- Interactive filtering options for user-friendly exploration.

## Predictive Model

The MSP prediction feature utilizes historical data to forecast crop prices for a specific year, assisting in data-driven agricultural planning.

## Requirements

To open and explore the Power BI dashboard:
1. Install Microsoft Power BI Desktop if not already installed. [Download here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/)
2. Open the provided `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.

## How to Use

1. Load the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Navigate through the pre-built dashboard tabs to explore insights.
3. Use slicers and filters for tailored analysis.
4. For the MSP prediction:
   - Refer to the predictive model section in the dashboard.
   - Input the required year and crop details to view predictions.

## Future Scope

- Expand the dataset with more recent records for enhanced insights.
- Integrate external factors like rainfall and market demand into the MSP prediction model.
- Publish the dashboard as an interactive Power BI service for real-time usage.
- Incorporate machine learning models for advanced predictions.
